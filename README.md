# Animals android app

Animals is a modern Android application designed to show a list of dogs currently. Built using Jetpack Compose, the first time our user gets in the applica1on we will make a @GET request, save this
information in a database, and the second time the user should ask for the List of DogsObjects,
and get the data from the database.
